# DoenerGL
A 3d Graphics Library for the Hollyhock 2 Launcher.
This is WIP, only a simple 1 Triangle Displaying function is Done.
This is based upon a Scratch Projects by me:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/600946840
A Version of this (or at least of the math of this project) can be found at Sean MCGinty and InterChans Project "HHK Game Engine"
This Library Requires a Div.s File to be compiled (LOL it uses Division).
This Library only runs on CPII Calculators.
Nobody forces you, but it would be great if you could give me credit for this in your Project(Just Keeping the Comments in the Lib is enough)
